## Tech Stack

**Client:** React, Redux, react-router-dom and TailwindCSS


### React
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is known for its simplicity, reusability, and performance, making it a popular choice for web development.

Key Features of React:

- **Component-Based**: React encourages a component-based architecture, where you break down the user interface into smaller, reusable components. This approach simplifies development and maintenance.
- **Virtual DOM**: React uses a virtual representation of the actual DOM to improve performance. It updates only the parts of the real DOM that have changed, resulting in faster rendering and a smoother user experience.
- **Declarative Syntax**: With React, you describe what your UI should look like at any given point, and React takes care of updating it efficiently when the data changes. This makes your code more predictable and easier to debug.
- **Large Ecosystem**: React has a vast ecosystem of libraries, tools, and community support, making it easier to integrate additional features and solve common challenges.

In our project, React is at the core of the user interface, providing a dynamic and interactive experience for users. For more details on how React is utilized in our project, please explore our codebase and refer to the official React documentation at React.

### Redux
Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications, often used with React to manage the application's state. In our project, Redux plays a crucial role in managing authentication.

How Redux Enhances Authentication:

- **State Management**: Redux allows us to manage the authentication state efficiently. It stores information about the user's authentication status, such as whether a user is logged in or not.
- **Authentication Actions**: We use Redux actions to perform authentication-related tasks, like login, logout, and updating user information. These actions help in maintaining a consistent and secure authentication flow.
- **User Data Storage**: Redux provides a structured way to store user data, ensuring that user-related information is easily accessible throughout the application.
- **Global Accessibility**: With Redux, authentication state is globally accessible, enabling components across the application to access the user's authentication status and related data.

In our project, Redux simplifies the authentication process, making it secure and easily manageable. For more details on using Redux for authentication, refer to our codebase and the Redux documentation at Redux.

### React Router DOM
React Router DOM is a library that helps with routing in React applications, enabling navigation between different parts of your app. One of its powerful features is the ability to create protected routes, which are routes that require authentication to access.

How React Router DOM Enhances Protected Routes:

- **Route Guarding**: React Router DOM allows us to implement route guarding, ensuring that certain routes are only accessible to authenticated users.
- **PrivateRoute Component**: We use the PrivateRoute component provided by React Router DOM to wrap routes that require authentication. This component checks if the user is authenticated and redirects to a login page if not.
- **User Redirection**: React Router DOM enables us to redirect users to specific pages based on their authentication status. For example, after successful login, users are redirected to a dashboard, and unauthorized users are redirected to a login page.
- **Dynamic Routing**: React Router DOM's dynamic routing capabilities make it easy to manage protected routes and ensure that only authorized users can access restricted parts of the application.
In our project, React Router DOM is instrumental in creating a secure and user-friendly navigation experience, particularly for routes that require authentication. For more details on using React Router DOM for protected routes, refer to our codebase and the React Router documentation at React Router DOM.

### TailwindCSS
Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that simplifies and accelerates the web development process. It allows you to build efficient, responsive, and customizable user interfaces without writing custom CSS styles from scratch.

Key Features of Tailwind CSS:

- **Utility Classes**: Tailwind CSS provides a vast set of utility classes that can be applied directly to HTML elements, making it easy to style and structure your components.
- **Responsive Design** : It includes responsive design classes, enabling you to create mobile-friendly layouts with minimal effort.
- **Customization**: Tailwind CSS is highly customizable. You can easily extend or configure the default styles to match your project's design requirements.
- **Modular Approach**: It promotes a modular approach to styling, which can improve code organization and reusability.

In our project, Tailwind CSS is used to style and layout components, providing a sleek and responsive design. For more details on how Tailwind CSS is employed in the project, please explore our codebase and refer to the Tailwind CSS documentation at Tailwind CSS.
